## requirements

Telegram API -- https://core.telegram.org/api#getting-started
Python Packages telethon -- https://pypi.org/project/Telethon/ 
                pandas -- https://pypi.org/project/pandas/

## usage

Download script to local machine. Run through terminal as python /path/to/script.py

Script will first require you to enter you Telegram API ID and API Hash.

Script will then prompt you to enter either a single channel ID, a comma seperated list, or a link to a txt file containing a comma separated list of channel IDs.

Next enter a cut off date for collection, leaving this box blank will scrape the whole channel but this will take a long time.

Enter paths to a folder for the script to place the downloaded files and run.
